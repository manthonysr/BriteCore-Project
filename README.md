# BriteCore-Project: 
For a project such as this, the very first order of business is to listen carefully to the requirements 
as provided by the client.  Then, I will always create an artifact of some sort that represents my understanding of 
what I've been told and get verification or "buy-off" to ensure everyone has an accurate understanding and is on the 
same page.
